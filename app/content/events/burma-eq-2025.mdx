  ### Overview  
  On March 28, 2025, a powerful 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck central Burma near Mandalay, causing widespread devastation and loss of life. The tremor resulted in over 3,300 fatalities (and counting), thousands of injuries, and significant damage to infrastructure and cultural heritage sites. The impact was also felt in neighboring countries, including Thailand, where buildings collapsed, leading to additional casualties. This earthquake highlights the devastating effects such natural disasters can have on communities and the importance of understanding seismic events.

  ### Fault Lines

  ##### USGS Fault Lines
  According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the earthquake's epicenter was near Mandalay, with a magnitude of 7.7. The event was associated with the Sagaing Fault, a major right-lateral strike-slip fault that accommodates significant tectonic movement between the Indo-Australian and Eurasian plates. This fault has a history of generating large earthquakes due to the ongoing tectonic convergence in the region.

  ### Black Marble Night Lights Analysis

  NASA's Black Marble project utilizes satellite data to monitor nighttime lights, providing insights into human settlements and infrastructure. Post-earthquake analyses indicated significant reductions in nighttime light intensity in the affected areas, reflecting power outages and disruptions to daily life. Such data is valuable for assessing the extent of impact and directing aid efforts.

  ### Synthetic Aperature Radar Ground Deformation

  The European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 satellites captured imagery revealing ground deformation resulting from the earthquake. Interferometric analysis showed significant surface displacement along the Sagaing Fault, with some areas experiencing shifts of up to six meters. This data is crucial for understanding the earthquake's mechanics and for future hazard assessments.

  ### Conclusion

  The earthquake resulted in over 3,300 deaths and more than 4,800 injuries (and counting). Hundreds remained missing in the aftermath. The disaster severely damaged infrastructure, including hospitals and schools, complicating rescue and relief operations. International aid was mobilized, with contributions from over 18 countries and organizations like the United Nations providing support. Recovery efforts faced challenges due to the extensive damage and the region's complex political situation. ​
