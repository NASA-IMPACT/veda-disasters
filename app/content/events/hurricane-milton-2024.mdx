    In response to Hurricane Milton, the NASA Disasters Response Coordination System (DRCS) is activated and collaborating directly with FEMA, USGS, NOAA, and FLGIO. DRCS is developing Earth observation maps and data products, all freely and publicly available on the NASA Disasters Mapping Portal. Keep scrolling to learn about and interact with these data products!

    NASA centers supporting the DRCS response include: Ames Research Center (ARC), Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the California Institute of Technology, Johnson Space Center (JSC), Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), and Langley Research Center (LaRC).

  ### Nighttime Lights 

  Nighttime Lights imagery is often used for identifying nighttime lights from cities, fires, boats, and other phenomena. At its highest resolution, this visualization represents the underlying data scaled to a resolution of 500m per pixel at the equator. These data were published daily from Oct. 4 to Oct. 17. A "pre-Helene" layer is also available from Sept. 24.

  Use the slider below to view changes in nighttime lights. More information on the Black Marble Blue/Yellow Composite product is available [here](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/news/feature-articles/new-black-marble-nighttime-blue-yellow-composite-product-makes-detecting).

  ### Water Extents

  ##### HydroSAR
  
  ESA's Sentinel 1 Synthetic Aperture Radar data was collected around ~7:30 am local time on Oct. 11, 2024 and was processed using collaborations with the Alaska Satellite Facility (hyperlink). DRCS used this data to develop a classified water extent data set that provides awareness of where flooding may have occurred after Milton.
  
  The slider below contains a colorized version of the SAR data (left) with the water extents overlaid.

  The Alaska Satellite Facility has developed false color Red, Green, Blue (RGB) and Radiometrically Terrain-Correct (RTC) composites and surface water extent products of the Sentinel-1A/B Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument which assigns the co- and cross-polarization information to a channel in the composite. When used to support a flooding event, areas in blue denotes water present at the time of the satellite overpass before or after the start of the flooding event.
  
  Sentinel-1 RGB Decomposition of RTC VV and VH imagery over United States coastlines. Blue areas have low returns in VV and VH (smooth surfaces such as calm water, but also frozen/crusted soil or dry sand), Green areas have high returns in VH (volume scatterers such as vegetation or some types of snow/ice), and red areas have relatively high VV returns and relatively low VH returns (such as urban or sparsely vegetated areas).

  ##### OPERA Dynamic Surface Water Extents

  The Advanced Rapid Imaging and Analysis (ARIA) and Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) teams at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and California Institute of Technology derived the OPERA Dynamic Surface Water eXtent change maps below using Sentinel-1 (DSWx-S1) data from Oct. 11 (Compared to Oct. 3 and 8) and Hybrid Landsat/Sentinel 2 (HLS) imagery from Oct. 11 and 12 (compared to Oct 2). These change maps indicate where flooding may have occurred. For more information please visit: https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera/products/dist-product-suite/.

  The results posted here are preliminary and unvalidated, primarily intended to aid the field response and people who want to have a rough first look at the water extent. The ARIA-share website has always focused on posting preliminary results as fast as possible for disaster response.

  ##### UAVSAR
  Between Oct. 11 and Oct. 14, DRCS worked with the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Airborne Science Program to collect data with the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar, which contains an L-band SAR sensor mounted on a manned aircraft. This data is most useful for identifying inundated vegetation. Additional information on these data is available in an article published to NASA.gov.

  [A separate storymap showcasing the UAVSAR data is available here.](https://maps.disasters.nasa.gov/arcgis/apps/storymaps/events/e5e9215abf0c4c44bd75720d683c0356)

  ### Vegetation Change Map

  From the European Space Agency Sentinel 2-A and 2-B satellites, the below 10m true color imagery shows how the Earth's surface would look to the naked eye from space. This optical imagery was collected on ** Oct. 12 and 14 ** following Hurricane Milton. The True Color RGBs below are produced using the 3 visible wavelength bands (red, green, and blue). False-color imagery featuring short wave infrared (SWIR) and near infrared (NIR) bands are also available as map image layers in the gallery.

  At 10m spatial resolution, this data can show landcover change, wide area flooding, severe road damage, and major change to urban areas. While not sufficient for structure-level damage assessments, it can reveal areas that may have been heavily impacted and locations of flood.

  DRCS performed a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) analysis on the Sentinel 2 data to identify areas that may have sustained impacts based on changes in vegetation. The Experimental Binary NDVI change product highlights areas that experienced change (of any kind) as compared to imagery from Oct. and Nov. 2023. The product is further filtered to reduce noise and focus on more pronounced areas of change in an effort to identify areas that may have experienced damage during Hurricane Helene's passage and associated water and wind impacts.
