    From Sept. 24 to Sept. 26, 2024, Hurricane Helene caused significant flooding, power outages, and damage across Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, and Tennessee. The NASA Disasters Response Coordination System (DRCS) activated and collaborated directly with FEMA, USGS, NOAA, the American Red Cross, and state emergency management agencies from Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia. 

    NASA centers supporting the DRCS response include: Ames Research Center (ARC), Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the California Institute of Technology, Johnson Space Center (JSC), Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), and Langley Research Center (LaRC).

    NASAâ€™s DRCS developed multiple Earth observation maps and data products to support response organizations. All products are free and publicly available on the NASA Disasters Mapping Portal. Key products include:

    <ul>
    <li> Nighttime lights </li>
    <li>Landslide maps </li>
    <li>Water extents </li>
    <li>Optical imagery </li>
    </ul>
    Keep scrolling to learn about and interact with these data products!

    ## Nighttime Lights
    Nighttime Lights imagery is often used for identifying nighttime lights from cities, fires, boats, and other phenomena. At its highest resolution, this visualization represents the underlying data scaled to a resolution of 500m per pixel at the equator. These data were published daily from Sept.

    The maps below compare pre-incident nighttime lights as seen on Sept. 22 (left) with a post-incident scene from Oct. 2 (center). DRCS created an experimental radiance change map aggregated by xipcode (right) to localize possible power outages and impacts. More information on Black Marble and a swipe app are available here.

    This product is under development. Currently it visualizes change in luminosity between the August Black Marble baseline and Oct. 2, 2024, aggregated at the zip code level. Red areas experienced the most loss in luminosity, while gray indicates no date or cloud coverage. For more information on the experimental luminosity change map, please contact us at drcs@nasa.gov.

    ## Water Extents
    OPERA Dynamic Surface Water eXtent (DSWx) change map - Florida
    The Advanced Rapid Imaging and Analysis (ARIA) and Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) teams at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and California Institute of Technology derived the surface water extent maps below using the OPERA Dynamic Surface Water eXtent from Sentinel-1 (DSWx-S1) products. The OPERA Dynamic Surface Water eXtent data covers the west coast of Florida only and visualized in the map below.

    In addition, OPERA has produced a Surface Disturbance product. The Disturbance product (DIST) maps per pixel vegetation disturbance (specifically, vegetation cover loss) from Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) scenes. This data is available for western North Carolina and surrounding areas, also in the map below. For more information about the Surface Disturbance product suite, please refer to the DIST Product page: https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera/products/dist-product-suite/

    The results posted here are preliminary and unvalidated, primarily intended to aid the field response and people who want to have a rough first look at the water extent. The ARIA-share website has always focused on posting preliminary results as fast as possible for disaster response.

    ## Alaska Satellite Facility HydroSAR Water Extents - North and South Carolina
    The Alaska Satellite Facility has developed false color Red, Green, Blue (RGB) and Radiometrically Terrain-Correct (RTC) composites and surface water extent products of the Sentinel-1A/B Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument which assigns the co- and cross-polarization information to a channel in the composite. When used to support a flooding event, areas in blue denotes water present at the time of the satellite overpass before or after the start of the flooding event.

    Sentinel-1 RGB Decomposition of RTC VV and VH imagery over United States coastlines. Blue areas have low returns in VV and VH (smooth surfaces such as calm water, but also frozen/crusted soil or dry sand), Green areas have high returns in VH (volume scatterers such as vegetation or some types of snow/ice), and red areas have relatively high VV returns and relatively low VH returns (such as urban or sparsely vegetated areas).

    The map below shows flood extents derived from these Sentinel 1 SAR decompositions in parts of North and South Carolina. Pre-incident data was collected on Sept. 16, and post-event data was collected Sept. 26, Sept. 28, and Oct. 3.

    ## Optical Imagery
    ### Sentinel 2
    From the European Space Agency Sentinel 2-A and 2-B satellites, the below 10m true color imagery shows how the Earth's surface would look to the naked eye from space. The True Color RGBs below are produced using the 3 visible wavelength bands (red, green, and blue). False-color imagery featuring short wave infrared (SWIR) and near infrared (NIR) bands are also available as map image layers in the gallery.

    At 10m spatial resolution, this data can show landcover change, wide area flooding, severe road damage, and major change to urban areas. While not sufficient for structure-level damage assessments, it can reveal areas that may have been heavily impacted and locations of flood.

    DRCS performed a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) analysis on the Sentinel 2 data to identify areas that may have sustained impacts based on changes in vegetation. The Experimental Binary NDVI change product is highlighting areas that experienced change (of any kind) since the pre-event Copernicus Sentinel-2 pass (22 September 2024) used in the analysis. The product is further filtered to reduce noise and focus on more pronounced areas of change in an effort to identify areas that may have experienced damage during Hurricane Helene's passage and associated water and wind impacts.

    The swipe app below allows users to interact with the experimental NDVI change product while viewing the pre-incident (right) and post-incident (left) imagery.

    ## Landsat
    The NASA/USGS Landsat program is the longest-running multispectral Earth imaging mission. True Color imagery from Landsat 8 and 9 is processed to 30m spatial resolution and shows how the Earth would look to the naked eye from space. The True Color RGB is produced using the 3 visible wavelength bands (red, green, and blue) from the respective sensor. Some minor atmospheric corrections have occurred.

    At 30m spatial resolution, this data can reveal flooding and wide-area landcover change. It is not sufficient for structure-level damage assessments but can provide situational awareness on hazard extents.
