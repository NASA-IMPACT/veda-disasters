  The NASA GSFC landslides team mapped landslides using the Semi-Automatic Landslide Detection (SALaD) system (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2021.106000). SALaD uses object-based image analysis and machine learning to map landslides. The landslide areas are derived from PlanetScope imagery. This map should be used as a guidance to identify areas affected by landslides.
