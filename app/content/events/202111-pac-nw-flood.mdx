  ### SALaD Landslide Detection - PlanetScope

  The NASA GSFC landslides team mapped landslides using the Semi-Automatic Landslide Detection (SALaD) system (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2021.106000). SALaD uses object-based image analysis and machine learning to map landslides. The landslide areas are derived from PlanetScope imagery. This map should be used as a guidance to identify areas affected by landslides.

  This is only a portion of the region where landslides occurred. Due to snow cover, we were unable to map landslides elsewhere for this event.


  **NOTE:** This is a rapid response product. We have not done any form of manual corrections, added small or missing landslides or resolved amalgamation for this product to be research grade.

  This PlanetScope imagery captured by Planet Labs Inc. in October and November 2021 shows some of the rainfall-induced landslides in one region of the Pacific Northwest. True Color RGB provides a product of how the surface would look to the naked eye from space. The True Color RGB is produced using the 3 visible wavelength bands (red, green, and blue) from the respective sensor. Some minor atmospheric corrections have occurred.

  **Suggested Use:**

  This map should be used as guidance to identify landslide affected areas. This is not a research grade product.

  ### Sentinel-2 True Color Imagery

  The True Color RGB composite provides a product of how the surface would look to the naked eye from space. The RGB is created using the red, green, and blue channels of the respective instrument.

  The Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) RGB is a product that is created using the SWIR, NIR, and Red channels of the respective instrument.

  **Suggested Use:**

  The True Color RGB provides a product of how the surface would look to the naked eye from space and may show damage caused by severe weather. The True Color RGB is produced using the 3 visible wavelength bands (red, green, and blue) from the respective sensor. Some minor atmospheric corrections have occurred.

  The Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) RGB is a product that can provides value in flood detection. Areas of water will appear blue, healthy green vegetation will appear as a bright green, urban areas in various shades of magenta, snow will appear as a bright blue/cyan, and bare soils being multicolor dependent on their makeup. Compare pre-event imagery to post-event imagery to identify potential flooding.

  ### Sentinel-1 Water Extent
  
  The Alaska Satellite Facility has developed water extent images using the Sentinel-1A/B Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument. These images can be used to see where water is located at the time of the satellite overpass. This product shows all water detected and does not differentiate between normal water and flood water. To determine where flooding may have occurred, combine this layer with a reference water layer.

  The Alaska Satellite Facility has developed a false color Red, Green, Blue (RGB) composite image of the Sentinel-1A/B Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument which assigns the co- and cross-polarization information to a channel in the RGB composite. When used to support a flooding event, areas in blue denotes water present at the time of the satellite overpass before or after the start of the flooding event.

  **Suggested Use:**

  In this image, water appears in blue, vegetated areas in shades of green and urban areas in bright orange. It is recommended to use this product with ancillary information to derive flooded areas.
