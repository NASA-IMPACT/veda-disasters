    # Sentinel-1 RGB Products

    ### Information About These Products:

    The Alaska Satellite Facility has developed a false color Red, Green, Blue (RGB) composite image of the Sentinel 1A/B Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument which assigns the co- and cross-polarization information to a channel in the RGB composite. When used to support a flooding event, areas in blue denotes water present at the time of the satellite overpass prior to the landfall of Hurricane Florence. The Sentinel-1 data was acquired before and after Hurricane Florence made landfall in southern North Carolina.

    ### Suggested Usage:

    In this image, water appears in blue, vegetated areas in shades of green and urban areas in bright orange. It is recommended to use this product with ancillary information to derive flooded areas.

    ### Satellite/Sensor/Resolution:

    # Sentinel-1 Flood Map

    ### Information About These Products:

    Using data collected from the European Space Agency's (ESA) Sentinel-1B satellite, scientists at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) are able to create maps of the extent of water due to the effects of Hurricane Florence which made landfall on September 15, 2018 in North Carolina. The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) aboard Sentinel-1B allows for the detection of water on the surface when clouds are present as well as during the night time hours.

    ### Suggested Usage:

    This product shows three areas: known reference water (blue), anomalous water identified outside the known reference water areas (red), and water detected in known wetlands or barren land (tan). The areas in red would be the likely flood waters due to the effects of Hurricane Florence.

    ### Satellite/Sensor/Resolution:

    Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) on European Space Agency's (ESA) Copernicus Sentinel-1A satellite; 30 m resolution.

    ### Credits/Acknowledgements:

    # UAVSAR Imagery

    ### Purpose/Summary:

    The overlay of the intensities of these three polarization channels allows user to visually classify a scene by its backscattering mechanism, such as surface scattering (strong HH and VV return), volume scattering (strong HV return) and double-bounce scattering (strong HH return). Areas dominated by green (HV) intensity are typically vegetated areas. Areas dominated by shades of pink (HH+HV) intensity are typically inundated forests or vegetated fields. Black and dark grey areas are usually smooth surface (roads, open water, smooth bare ground) where there is very little radar backscatter.

    ### Technical Data Information:

    RGB (HH, HV, VV polarizations) color overlay image; orthorectified and geolocated to about 50-100 m accuracy; data are scaled to about 40 dB dynamic range and stored as one byte per pixel.

    ### Suggested Usage:

    The polarimetric color composite is well suited for identifying inundation under tree canopies. This product is especially useful in mapping inundation extent in regions covered with vegetation where the ground is not visible in optical imagery.

    ### Satellite/Sensor/Resolution:

    UAVSAR airborne L-band synthetic aperture radar aboard a NASA Gulfstream C-20A jet. Resolution: 10 m

    # Black Marble Nighttime Imagery

    ### Information About These Products:
    
    From NASA Black Marble product suite, the images of nighttime lights in Hurricane Florence region of interest areas are based on data captured by the Suomi NPP satellite. The data was acquired by the Day/Night Band (DNB) of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), which detects light in a range of wavelengths from green to near-infrared, including city lights and lights from other human activity. The Black Marble Level 3 and HD data are continuously being produced and delivered for the latest day available.

    ### Suggested Usage:
    
    The NASA Black Marble product suite is useful to assess disruptions in energy infrastructure and utility services following major disasters. In these images, areas in white are in high-light condition, while areas in blue are in low-light condition potentially due to Hurricane Florence. It is recommended to use this product for mapping of power outages.

    # Black Marble HD Nighttime City Imagery

    ### Purpose/Summary:
    
    From NASA Black Marble product suite, the images of nighttime lights in Hurricane Florence areas are based on data captured by the Suomi NPP satellite, with an equator crossing time of approximately 1:30 am local time. The data was acquired by the Day/Night Band (DNB) of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), which detects light in a range of wavelengths from green to near-infrared, including city lights and lights from other activity. The NASA Black Marble standard product is available on a daily basis within 3-5 hours after acquisition at 500m spatial resolution from January 2012 to present. The Black Marble high definition (HD) product is being developed at 30m spatial resolution with data from other earth observing satellites (e.g., Landsat-8, Sentinel-2) and ancillary data sources (street, building, and other GIS layers). The pre-event images for Hurricane Florence are based on the composite Black Marble images between August 10 and Sep 11 2018. The Black Marble standard and HD products are continuously being produced and delivered for the latest day available.

    ### Suggested Usage:
    
    On September 14, 2018, widespread power failures were reported across the state of North Carolina. In preparations for this event NASA’s Disasters program employed one of its core capabilities, NASA’s Black Marble product suite, to enable immediate access to data documenting disruptions in energy infrastructure and utility services. In these images, areas in red are in high-light condition, while areas in black are in low-light condition before the arrival of Hurricane Florence.
    
    Use the bookmarks widget to view highlighted cities with noticeable differences in nighttime lighting, potentially due to power outages. Then use the swipe tool to view the difference between imagery from before and after Hurricane Florence made landfall.

    # VIIRS Nighttime Imagery

    ### Information About These Products:
    
    NASA’s Short-term Prediction Research and Transition (SPoRT) Center at Marshall produces false color composites of Suomi-NPP VIIRS instrument day night band (DNB) radiance and infrared cloud and land surface temperatures (M15). DNB imagery is assigned to red and green channels and brightness temperatures to blue shades, allowing a combined display of nighttime lights, fires, reflected moonlight and occasional lightning in shades of yellow (new moon) to white (full moon) along with blue tinting of cloud imagery. This color combination is based upon usage developed by the Naval Research Lab and shared with partners in NOAA’s National Weather Service. VIIRS DNB image produced September 10, 2018 at 06:46 UTC.

    ### Suggested Usage:
    
    In this image, city lights appear in bright shades of yellow to white when not obscured by clouds (shades of blue to white). Visual comparisons of pre- and post-event scenes allow for subjective identification of where lights are missing as a result of disaster impacts on local infrastructure that have caused damages to structures or utilities.

    ### Satellite/Sensor:
    
    Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) use of the day-night band and M15 thermal infrared band. S-NPP is a joint mission between NASA and NOAA. Similar capabilities are available from the NOAA-20 mission.

    ### Credit/Acknowledgements:
    
    False color RGB products from Suomi-NPP VIIRS were generated by NASA’s Short-term Prediction Research and Transition (SPoRT) Center at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

    # ARIA Flood Map

    ### Information About These Products:
    
    The Advanced Rapid Imaging and Analysis (ARIA) team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, created this Flood Proxy Map depicting areas of Carolinas that are likely flooded as a result of Hurricane Florence. The images were taken before (October 12, 2016) and at the time (September 14, 2018 7:15 AM local time) when Hurricane Florence made landfall near Wilmington, NC. The map covers an area of 155 miles x 233 miles (250 km x 375 km). Each pixel measures about 33 yards x 33 yards (30 m x 30 m). Media reports provided anecdotal preliminary validation. Sentinel-1 data were accessed through the Copernicus Open Access Hub. 

    ### Suggested Usage:
    
    Likely flooded areas are depicted in light blue. This flood proxy map should be used as guidance to identify areas that are likely flooded, and may be less reliable over urban and vegetated areas.

    ### Satellite/Sensor:
    
    Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) from Copernicus Sentinel-1 operated by the European Space Agency (ESA); 30 meter resolution.

    ### Credits/Acknowledgments:
    
    The image contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data (2018), processed by ESA and analyzed by the NASA-JPL/Caltech ARIA team. This research was carried out at JPL funded by NASA Disasters Program. For more information about ARIA, visit: http://aria.jpl.nasa.gov

    # ARIA Damage Map

    ### Information About These Products:
    
    The Advanced Rapid Imaging and Analysis (ARIA) team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, created this Damage Proxy Map (DPM) depicting areas of Carolinas that are likely damaged (shown by red and yellow pixels) as a result of Hurricane Florence. The map is derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites, operated by the European Space Agency (ESA). The images were taken before (September 02, 2016) and 12 hours after the hurricane's landfall (September 14, 2018 7:06 PM local time). Media reports provided anecdotal preliminary validation. Sentinel-1 data were accessed through the Copernicus Open Access Hub.
    
    ### Suggested Usage:
    
    Likely damaged areas due to the effects of Hurricane Florence are shown by red and yellow pixels. The color variation from yellow to red indicates increasingly more significant ground surface change. This DPM should be used as guidance to identify damaged areas, and may be less reliable over vegetated areas and flooded areas. For example, the scattered single colored pixels over vegetated areas may be false positives, and the lack of colored pixels over vegetated areas does not necessarily mean no damage.

    # Flooding and Debris

    ### Information About These Products:
    
    This Band 532 RGB was created by NASA using USGS Landsat-8 satellite . It provides a false color composite look at the surface of the Earth.
    
    ### Suggested Usage: 
    
    Use the Swipe tool to compare pre and post-event imagery to see where flooding has occurred. Black colored areas are typically water and flooding is visible near rivers and nearby fields. Further downstream large amounts of soil, sediment, pollution and other debris can be seen flowing into bays, estuaries, and the nearshore ocean. These debris are an important measure of water quality and has important implications for drinking water, aquatic ecosystems and metal transport.
